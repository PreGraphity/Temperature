This repository contains data related to Temperature (Tº) measurements taken in the Santimamiñe, Lumentxa and Altxerri caves from 2008 
to 2023 by the company CONSULTORES INDEPENDIENTES EN GESTIÓN DE RECURSOS NATURALES, S.A. (CRN) in the first and the last
caves, and by Diego Garate, Martin Arriolabengoa and Iñaki Intxaurbe in the case of Lumentxa.

and by the Department of Culture and Language Policy of the Basque Government for the last two (Lumentxa and Altxerri).

kobazuloen dinamika eta labar artearen babesa” (021-KOI-2020), and “Labartest: Kobazuloko labar artearen material piktorikoaren 
kontserbazioa neurtzeko sistema” (011-KOI-2021), directed by Diego Garate, authorized by the Cultural Heritage Service of the
